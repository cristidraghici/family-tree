## Intro to genealogy trees

Creating a genealogy tree involves researching, organizing, and presenting information about your family's history. Here are some best practices to consider when creating a genealogy tree:

- Start with Yourself: begin with your own information and work backward;
- Collect information from family members, old documents, photos, and any existing family records;
- Keep track of your sources. Document where you found each piece of information, whether it's an official document, family Bible, or oral history;
- Strive for accuracy in all details. Cross-check information from different sources to ensure its reliability;
- Collaborate with other family members interested in genealogy;
- Be mindful of privacy concerns, especially for living individuals. Avoid sharing sensitive or private information without consent;
- Genealogy is an ongoing process. Regularly update your family tree as new information becomes available, and continue your research;
- Familiarize yourself with genealogical research methods, historical context, and record-keeping practices.

Remember, genealogy is a journey, and it often involves uncovering fascinating stories about your ancestors. Enjoy the process and consider joining genealogy communities for support and additional resources.
